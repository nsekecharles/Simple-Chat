# Simple-Chat

This is a simple chat application. I have launched this project to give some examples on how I use my favorites front-end tools.

Feel free to add a new feature or correct if I do something in an unconventional way I'm not an expert.

What is used in this project:
- nodeJs ---> for the chat server side
- AngularJs ---> my favorite front-end framework I can't do a project without this
- Velocity Js ---> this is a very good framework when you want to do animation (I have never use this before)
- Socket.io ---> for the chat client and server side
- twitter bootstrap ---> to have a responsive application
- Grunt ---> 
- Bower --->
- ... ---> why ?
- 

To start the node server just run the command 'node server' at the root of the project the server will be listening at the port 4490...

To start to client side server just run the command 'grunt' at the root of the project. The web server will be listening on the port 4000. You can test now on your web browser via the address localhost:4000/home
